This work aims to increase communication and social inclusion for Nepalâ€™s
300,000+ deaf people by developing recognition technology for Nepali Sign Language (NSL). Compared to larger sign languages, NSL has not received as much
technological attention, which has hindered social interaction. Using the YOLOv8
architecture, we created a high-accuracy NSL gesture detection system to overcome this issue. Its accuracy on the NSL23 dataset, which included 1,205 gestures
in 630 videos, was 98.6%. To increase variability, the dataset was carefully
annotated and preprocessed using augmentation techniques. Our real-time solution makes it possible for assistive devices to be used practically, which greatly
improves accessibility for NSL users. This study lays the groundwork for future
developments in sign language technology for languages with fewer resources by
offering a scalable solution for NSL recognition.
