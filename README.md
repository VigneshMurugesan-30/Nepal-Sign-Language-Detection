This project aims to enhance social engagement and communication for Nepal's 300,000+ deaf population by developing recognition technologies for Nepali Sign Language (NSL). Compared to larger sign languages, NSL has been less focused on technology, which has hindered social bonding. We used the YOLOv8 architecture to create a high-accuracy NSL gesture recognition system in order to address this issue. Its accuracy was 98.6% on the NSL23 dataset, which included 1,205 motions in 630 videos. To increase variability, the dataset was carefully annotated and preprocessed using augmentation techniques. The practical usage of assistive equipment is made possible by our real-time solution, which greatly improves accessibility for NSL users. This study lays the groundwork for future developments in sign language technology for languages with low resources, which provides a scalable solution for NSL recognition.
